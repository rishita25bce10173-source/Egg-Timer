# Egg-Timer
A fun command_line project for perfect eggs every time.
An egg timer is needed to perfectly time the cooking of eggs, ensuring they are soft, medium, or hard-boiled to your exact preference. 
We can also add different ways of eggs like omelet and sunny side up. While traditional kitchen timers are set to a specific duration, modern egg timers can use color-changing technology or other indicators to show you the egg's doneness in real-time as it cooks in the water. 
This eliminates guesswork and helps achieve consistently cooked eggs every time. 
In this, it demonstrates how python can be used for real=life utility applications like timers. 
Egg timer is useful as it helps in cooking tasks, is more flexible and customizable than a physical timer, can run on a computer or laptop, or even a phone, and most importantly, it is good for learning programming.
The python modules and libraries used are:
time() : it handles the countdown and sleep functions for the timer
datetime() : it manages time calculations and displays formatted timestamps
sys() : It enables command-line interaction and clean program exits.
I used github and python idle for my project.
